how do you place prefabs and tiles?

prefabs:
1. go to: Assets > Furniture_pixel_art_assets > Prefabs > Furniture_props
2. drag the prefab you selected into the scene

tiles:
1. go to: Assets > Furniture_pixel_art_assets > Furniture_tiles
2. drag the tile you selected into the scene

tip: if you want to have the prefabs and tiles in correct order (for example, that the carpet is over the floor) add a Sorting Layer and the Order in Layer under Sprite Renderer
